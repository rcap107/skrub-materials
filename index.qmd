This is the Skrub learning materials website. This website is used to host all the material 
used to teach and present Skrub to audiences. 


Slides for presentations, talks and lectures are in [slides section](slides/index_slides.qmd).
Notebooks and blog posts are instead located in the [notebook section](notebooks/index_notebooks.qmd).

Note that the material that is gathered here may include material that has been 
modified in later versions of Skrub.

Updated information on Skrub and its API can be found in the 
[documentation](https://skrub-data.org/stable/reference/index.html), and 
additional examples are available in the 
[gallery](https://skrub-data.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html) on the main 
website. Examples on the website are guaranteed to work with the latest version 
of skrub.
